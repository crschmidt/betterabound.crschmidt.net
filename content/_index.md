Aventon's Abound cargo bike is an inexpensive option for families. Members of
the community have come up with some ways to improve upon or expand the 
capabilities of the bike. This project is meant to collect tips, tricks,
tools and expansions from members of the Abound ecosystem.

* [Cafe Lock](/cafe-lock/): Add a mount for a front wheel-lock, and a chain
  for theft protection.
* [Winter Kit](/winter-kit/): Use the Tern Storm Box and Storm Shield with your
  Aventon Abound.
* [Improved Seatpad Mounting](/seatpad/): Find out how to more securely mount
  your seatpad to the bike, and how to get seating in front of your child seat.
* [Technical documents](/docs/): Various Abound technical documents.

onto bikes.**
