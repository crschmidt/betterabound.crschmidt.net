title: "Better Crates"
---

On cargo bikes carrying kids, the rear deck turns from cargo capacity into 
kid capacity, which means that riders need to find new places to store stuff.
On most long-tail cargo bikes, mounting a front rack is a useful place to
do this.

While many bike companies offer front baskets, they often are insufficient
for cargo needs.

High quality storage has the properties that it is:

* Sturdy: Can hold heavy loads.
* Deep: Shallow baskets and bumpy roads go poorly together. A deep front
  storage area is very useful.
* Large: You'll want something that can carry a lot.

The solution that we've found works best for the Abound is a double-wide rectangle milk crate from [Milk Crates Direct](https://milkcratesdirect.com/), combined with the Front Utility Rack and some mounting hardware.

Aventon Abound
--------------

| Item | Typical Cost (Individual pricing) |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| [Front Utility Rack](https://www.aventon.com/products/aventon-front-utility-rack) | $70 | 
| [24 qt milk crate](https://www.milkcratesdirect.com/rectangular-milk-crates-6-gallon-24-quart/rectangular-milk-crate-24qt) | $10, plus $11 shipping |
| 2 M5 bolts and nylock washers | $3 |
| 2 1.5" fender washers | $2 |

The Aventon front basket is too small to serve cargo needs for many users, which is why we go with the crate. 

Tern HSD, GSD, Quick-Haul
-------------------------

On a Tern, you can replicate the setup by using the [Hauler Rack](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/accessories/471/hauler-rack).

| Item | Typical Cost (Individual pricing) |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| [Hauler Rack](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/accessories/471/hauler-rack) | $140 | 
| [24 qt milk crate](https://www.milkcratesdirect.com/rectangular-milk-crates-6-gallon-24-quart/rectangular-milk-crate-24qt) | $10, plus $11 shipping |
| 2 M5 bolts and nylock washers | $3 |
| 2 1.5" fender washers | $2 |

The 24 quart mik crate is large enough to carry two bags of groceries; fit several kids backpacks, etc. 

If you have already purchased the Transporteur Rack for your Tern, the [Grainger 5YN07](https://www.grainger.com/product/AKRO-MILS-Straight-Wall-Container-6-5YN07) crate is reported to work well with it according to [Ashburn Bicycle Repair](https://ashburnbicyclerepair.com/blogs/news/best-crates-for-tern-gsd-and-hsd-shortbed-tray-and-transporteur-rack).
