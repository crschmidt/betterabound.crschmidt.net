When bringing kids around in the winter, having an enclosure to keep them out
of the snow and wind can expand the days that you can ride your bike. However,
Aventon does not currently sell any kind of enclosure for the Abound.

Tern produces two useful accessories for this: the [Storm Box](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/accessories/471/storm-box) and the [Storm Shield](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/accessories/473/storm-shield). Due to the similar sizing between the Tern Clubhouse and the Abound Handrail, these can be installed on the 
Abound, but the Handrail lacks some attachment points that help provide 
additional stability, especially to the Storm Shield.

To improve the stability of an installed Storm Box and Storm Shield, you can
add a 3D printed set of mounting points. These mounts attach with screws to
the Handrail, through the mid-bar mounting holes.

## Installation

1. 3D print the [Abound Clubhouse Mounting Nubs](https://www.printables.com/model/631824-aventon-abound-tern-gsd-clubhouse-mounting-nubs).
1. Remove the screws holding the middle-handrail bars from the Handrail.
2. Mount the 3D-printed nubs to the bar, attaching each with an M6x40mm screw
   to hold the plastic part in place.
3. Install the Storm Box and Storm Shield following the [Tern Installation 
   Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InSUGee75fM).
4. Attach the base of the Storm Box to the Abound footboards using 12" zipties.
